### Goal
The goal of this **proof of concept** is to **guarantee** synchronous audio playback for the current Web Audio API standard **without** relying on support of [outputLatency](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext/outputLatency) or [baseLatency](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext/baseLatency).
