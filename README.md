#### Installation and running
Default installation technique with any JavaScript package manager that understands the default `package.json` format.
E.g. with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-install) with `npm install`, or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/install) with `yarn install`.

Running is done with `node server.js`, and will host a minimal [Express](http://expressjs.com/) web-server on port 3000.
